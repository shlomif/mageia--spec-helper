For information.

Starting  from  rpm-3.0.4-0.2mdk,  the  spec-helper  package  must  be
installed as a dependency of the rpm-build package.

The  spec-helper script  is called  automatically  at the  end of  the
%install  section to  compress info  and  man pages,  strip files  and
remove backup files from the $RPM_BUILD_ROOT dir. The %install section
can be  cleaned off this  tasks but the  %files section about  man and
info pages must be specified without  the .bz2 extension but with an *
instead. The goal is to have vendor neutral spec files.

Example:

%files
/usr/man/man1/alias.1*

and not

%files
/usr/man/man1/alias.1.bz2
